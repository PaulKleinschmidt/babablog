Ember.js

## How Its Made

babaBlog is my first project using Ember.js. I started by building the api on rails. After adding a new resource, I set up the components and routes needed on the front end. I followed the data down, action up process to make my changes on the front end persist to the database. I divided my views up into components as much as possible. After completing the first resource, I added the comments resource so that users could comment on posts.

## Whats Next?

I have been working on a likes resource that I hope to have done in the future. I would like users to be able to like posts and comments. I would also like to have a way of sorting posts

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to comment on a post
